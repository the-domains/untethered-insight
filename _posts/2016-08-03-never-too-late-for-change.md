**Never Too Late For Change!**

I have worn many different hats in my life. From retail sales, to insurance, to mortgage, to technology, to teaching.. Even more little things in between those major ones.

I was 19 years old working for a major shoe retailer as a manager. I enjoyed my job most of the time. I did feel it took up too much of my time as many days I would work 12 hour shifts. But at 19, living on my own, having to pay all my own bills and making enough to have fun. I felt "ok"...

Then one busy holiday season day, the printer for one of the computer systems of the shoe retail store stopped working.. the senior manager was upset and said something that I would remember forever.. He said "I sell shoes! I don't fix computers!"

Those words resonated with me. I thought "Was that something that I would be PROUD to say?" and my answer was No, No its wasn't.

Now I'm not going to say I went straight from the retail store into computers, I didn't. I obtained a better job, making more money in insurance, then again years later in the mortgage industry. I managed to obtain several computer certifications during this time period as I really enjoyed learning about computers; (A+, Network+, MCSE, Apple ACTC)

In 2000, I had a job with a Major Insurance Provider. I was an Insurance Representative but exclusively over the phone through an 800 number. During the initial period of this job I would handle about 2 calls a day(10 hours) and the rest I would just be on the computer.

This would be the time when I first became interested in Web Development. During the long stretches of not having any work to do, as there were no customers to talk to, I taught myself HTML to build Websites. I was owner to a Dragonball Z fan website which did manage to get thousands of hits a day. **I would not know until years later what I could've done if I stuck with it.**

In 2006, when the whole mortgage industry and economy went bust, so did the jobs I had. After being laid off by 3 mortgage companies in a span of 6 months due to bankruptcies, I finally decided to pursue my passion of computers as a career. It was difficult as I knew my pay would in no way match what I was making before being laid off, but it was time and I think "a sign" to take my next step.

Fast Forward in time to today. I am successful and happy in what I do now, which is being a Technology Coordinator for an educational institution. I have the pleasure to work with computers on a daily basis. You can say a Technology Coordinator consist of many roles; Network Administrator, Technology Liaison, Teacher, Technology Director. Basically, if it involves touching a computer I am the go to person for it.

So with all this you might say:

_**"If you are happy, then why take another step?"**_

I have always been the type of person that LOVES to learn new things. That LOVES to know how things works. That LOVES to build. I have learned computer hardware and software repair. I have learn computer networking, I have learned how to teach my skills to others. I have built networks and computers and managed them.

But now I want to continue my love of learning, my love of knowing how things work and my love of building.

I look back at that time when I built the Dragonball Z Site and think "If I had stuck with Web Development and not moved into Network Administration, where would I be?" This led me to want to pursue my next journey....Web Application Development...to become a Software Engineer.

I never feel its too late to do something..... And thus it was time to take action!
