From retail sales, to insurance, to mortgage, to technology, to teaching.. Even more little things in between those major ones.</p><p>I was 19 years old working for a major shoe retailer as a manager. I enjoyed my job most of the time. I did feel it took up too much of my time as many days I would work 12 hour shifts. But at 19, living on my own, having to pay all my own bills and making enough to have fun. I felt “ok”…</p><p>Then one busy holiday season day, the printer for one of the computer systems of the shoe retail store stopped working.. the senior manager was upset and said something that I would remember forever.. He said “I sell shoes! I don’t fix computers!”</p><p>Those words resonated with me. I thought “Was that something that I would be PROUD to say?” and my answer was No, No its wasn’t.</p><p>Now I’m not going to say I went straight from the retail store into computers, I didn't. I obtained a better job, making more money in insurance, then again years later in the mortgage industry. I managed to obtain several computer certifications during this time period as I really enjoyed learning about computers; (A+, Network+, MCSE, Apple ACTC)</p><p>In 2000, I had a job with a Major Insurance Provider. I was an Insurance Representative but exclusively over the phone through an 800 number. During the initial period of this job I would handle about 2 calls a day(10 hours) and the rest I would just be on the computer.</p><p>This would be the time when I first became interested in Web Development. During the long stretches of not having any work to do, as there were no customers to talk to, I taught myself HTML to build Websites. I was owner to a Dragonball Z fan website which did manage to get thousands of hits a day. <strong>I would not know until years later what I could’ve done if I stuck with it.</strong></p><p>In 2006, when the whole mortgage industry and economy went bust, so did the jobs I had. After being laid off by 3 mortgage companies in a span of 6 months due to bankruptcies, I finally decided to pursue my passion of computers as a career. It was difficult as I knew my pay would in no way match what I was making before being laid off, but it was time and I think “a sign” to take my next step.</p><p>Fast Forward in time to today. I am successful and happy in what I do now, which is being a Technology Coordinator for an educational institution. I have the pleasure to work with computers on a daily basis. You can say a Technology Coordinator consist of many roles; Network Administrator, Technology Liaison, Teacher, Technology Director. Basically, if it involves touching a computer I am the go to person for it.</p><p>So with all this you might say:</p><p><em><strong>“If you are happy, then why take another step?”</strong></em></p><p>I have always been the type of person that LOVES to learn new things. That LOVES to know how things works. That LOVES to build. I have learned computer hardware and software repair. I have learn computer networking, I have learned how to teach my skills to others. I have built networks and computers and managed them.</p><p>But now I want to continue my love of learning, my love of knowing how things work and my love of building.</p><p>I look back at that time when I built the Dragonball Z Site and think “If I had stuck with Web Development and not moved into Network Administration, where would I be?” This led me to want to pursue my next journey….Web Application Development…to become a Software Engineer.</p><p>I never feel its too late to do something…..
