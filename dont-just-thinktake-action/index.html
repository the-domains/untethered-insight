I like to think of things before I do them. I also do tons of research for almost everything; Appliances, Printers, Cars, Lawnmowers. If I bought it, its because it came with a ton of research beforehand.</p><p>Choosing where to go to begin my new journey was VERY HARD. I knew from the get go I would not be attending a traditional 4 year education for this, as I am the kind of person that wants to learn what I want to learn (Web Development, Algorithims and Data Structures) and not all the additional fluff like “English 102” and such.</p><p>Also the time restraints of having a full time job and a wonderful family, I needed something that would put me up to speed quick.</p><p>So I knew I would be choosing a “Bootcamp”</p><p>Through my research I have learned that to really learn how to find issues and better solutions in code would be to understand algorithms and data structures and this is something most bootcamp students don’t grasp. So this was something I would not budge on.</p><p>If you are reading this its probably because you are on your search as well. The first place I saw was of course Hack Reactor, the reviews from all over the place were great and I couldn't find anything negative about them. I was interested in their Remote Beta Program, then I looked at the time line. 12 hours a day for over 3 months of time. Even with being off in the summers there was no way I could pull that off. I still had bills to pay. I can say that this did open my eyes to what exactly I would need to be looking for:</p><ul><li><strong>A program I can do and keep my job</strong></li><li><strong>A program that had mentors that cared</strong></li><li><strong>A program that actually taught what I was looking for</strong></li><li><strong>A program with a real world curriculum</strong></li><li><strong>A program with a manageable price</strong></li></ul><p>I narrowed my search down some with this criteria. I looked into “Anyone Can Learn to Code” in Chicago and <a href="http://Bloc.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloc.io</a></p><p>First was “Anyone Can Learn to Code”… I myself am an educator, I teach computers to middle school students as part of my Technology Coordinator Role, so hearing that the teacher was an educator made a big difference. Downsides were there was no fully remote option and I did not see anything in reviews or on their website regarding learning the intricacies of algorithms and data structures, plus the price jumped from like $9,000 when I first looked into it to like $12,500 today. (FYI. I first looked into it about a year ago)</p><p>Then there was <a href="http://Bloc.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloc.io</a>, I was first looking into their Full Stack Track. They had a decent price and was fully remote. I read through tons of reviews and seen things that had me thinking. Like their mentors were hit or miss, some wouldn't even show up for their appointments and that the curriculum was not that great.</p><p>Then I was sent an email from Bloc talking about “Introducing the Software Engineering Track”. This immediately peaked my interest! I looked at the website info and was super impressed. They covered everything I was looking for. Time wise I knew it would take very long, that was expected with such a program that says it will REPLACE A CS DEGREE! I attended an info session and I liked what I saw. I even came super close to signing up! But 2 things occurred. First, the price is an astounding $24,000! But even then, I was still about to sign up. Then I went through another info session and someone asked a question that made me jump back and say “Why didn't I think of such a simple question”.</p><p>The question was “You say this Software Engineering Track will replace a CS Degree, How can you (Bloc) make that claim?”</p><p>Their answer was “Because I have been through a traditional CS Degree Program”….. That was the answer… No Facts, No Trials, No Betas….<br>Just because they went through the traditional CS degree, they knew it was a replacement.</p><p>That did not sit well with me.. If I am spending $24,000 and a year and a half of my time, I want to make sure I am getting as promised. Some evidence this program works as they claim. Now I know they have a money back guarantee if you don’t find a job making at least $60,000 a year after the program and thats great.. But there is no way they can pay me back for the year and a half I may have lost, time is not refundable.</p><p>I honestly thought I wasn't going to find anything. Then as I was wandering Course Report one day and I come across an online bootcamp I never heard of:<br>Firehose Project.</p><p>I read the reviews and they all seemed great! I looked into more reviews around the internet and couldn't find a legit bad review. I looked into their website and their curriculum was all laid out in public view to see. They even covered Algorithms and Data Structures!</p><p>What was even more awesome is that they give you FREE access to their introduction course. And its not some “Go to Code Academy” and do this or that. It an actual in-house created course. I wouldn't have to pay a dime to try it out. I can see everything I would learn in front of me.</p><p>I went ahead and signed up for the intro course and got started right away. First thing built was a static webpage with HTML and CSS. The lessons were very detailed and concise. What was even more awesome is through this intro course you have actual mentors reviewing your code and have a discussion board to ask any question. The rest of the intro course is Ruby basics and you have to submit your “Coding Challenges” for review by the mentors. In one of the challenges I moved ahead on my own and used some Ruby extensions that did work, but the mentor said that they are happy to see that I am going above and beyond, but KNOWING how Ruby works without the extensions is important and to try it without them. I was happy they did this as I just looked for the easy way out. But with all I had to do I do feel like I got a better learning experience, not shortcuts! And keep in mind, all this was free!</p><p>I completed the Intro Course in about a week and day but I still wanted to talk with someone. Marco, which is a co-founder, had been emailing me back and forth regarding my code during the intro course, gave me the option to speak with me directly and answer all my questions personally. We set up a Skype chat and he was at the scheduled appointment! How many places can you say has one of the founders is reviewing your code and will speak with you one-on-one?</p><p>Marco was very helpful in his chat with me and went over everything we will go through including what I want to learn most Algorithms and Data Structures. He even calmed my nerves about not knowing math like a mathematician to be able to be a great developer. There wasn't any question he wouldn't answer.</p><p>After going through this, all my thinking, all my research I took action and signed up for The Firehose Project and begin the Full Program tomorrow!<br>I really feel this is the right choice for me</p><p>I am excited on what this next journey of my life will bring!</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="30"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="31"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

I even came super close to signing up! But 2 things occurred. First, the price is an astounding $24,000! But even then, I was still about to sign up.
